# The Dyadic Plenum: Dynamic Hyper-Continuum Mechanics (DHCM)

This repository presents "The Dyadic Plenum," a monolithic theoretical framework aiming to unify fundamental physics with the nature of consciousness. Authored by Mark A. Banne, this paper introduces **Dynamic Hyper-Continuum Mechanics (DHCM)** and **Syncytial Field Theory (SFT)**.

## Abstract Summary

The paper posits that the universe's fundamental ontological substrate is not a static void but a **Holostrome**—a non-causal, superfluid plenum characterized by infinite intrinsic velocity and fractal geometry. From this axiom, it derives Quantum Mechanics as the hydrodynamic limit of particles navigating a fractal noise floor, and General Relativity as the Bernoulli pressure dynamics of this superfluid vacuum.

Key resolutions include:
-   **Dark Matter Crisis**: Addressed by a **Logarithmic Superfluid (LogSE)** model, where dark matter effects are explained as a phase transition from laminar flow to turbulent vortex shedding in galactic halos, without invoking invisible particles.
-   **Binding Problem in Neuroscience**: Resolved by **Syncytial Field Theory (SFT)**, which postulates that consciousness is a thermodynamic phase transition within the **Astroglial Syncytium**. Here, discrete neuronal spiking is smoothed into continuous subjective experience via cytoskeletal hysteresis and "Armored" Posner molecule resonance.

The paper concludes by proposing specific falsification protocols, including "The Ghost Cable" experiment, designed to isolate non-local field awareness from causal signaling.

## Key Concepts and Contributions

*   **Holostrome**: The fundamental superfluid, fractal spacetime plenum of infinite agitation and intrinsic velocity.
*   **Dynamic Hyper-Continuum Mechanics (DHCM)**: A framework that unifies QM and GR as hydrodynamic limits of the Holostrome.
    *   **Quantum Mechanics as Hydrodynamics**: The wavefunction ($\psi$) is reinterpreted as real fluid dynamics, and the Quantum Potential ($Q$) as the osmotic pressure of the vacuum. Entanglement is explained as hydraulic rigidity in a superfluid, the double-slit experiment via pilot-wave interference, and tunneling as fractal trajectories.
    *   **Gravity as Bernoulli Pressure**: Gravity is reframed as the osmotic pressure of the vacuum rushing into "low-pressure" zones created by mass.
*   **Logarithmic Superfluid Vacuum (LogSE)**: A model explaining galactic rotation curves without dark matter particles, attributing "dark matter" effects to vacuum turbulence.
*   **Syncytial Field Theory (SFT)**: Proposes that consciousness arises from the continuous, brain-wide **Astroglial Syncytium** (a network of fused astrocytes) through a "Hysteresis Handover" mechanism, converting discrete neuronal spikes into continuous field experiences.
*   **Falsification Protocols**: Specific experimental designs ("The Ghost Cable" and "Isotope Coherence Test") aimed at empirically validating the non-causal and quantum aspects of the proposed field of awareness.
