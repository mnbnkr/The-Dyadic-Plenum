# The Dyadic Plenum (Working Draft)

This repository contains the current manuscript for **"The Dyadic Plenum,"** a theoretical framework attempting to unify fundamental physics with the biology of consciousness.

**The Core Concept**
The theory rejects the "Static Void" model of the universe. Instead, it posits that the vacuum is a **Holostrome**—a superfluid plenum characterized by infinite intrinsic velocity and fractal geometry. By treating spacetime as a fluid, we can derive both Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity as hydrodynamic limits of the same underlying system.

**Key Theoretical Pillars:**

*   **Dynamic Hyper-Continuum Mechanics (DHCM):**
    *   **Gravity as Pressure:** Reinterprets gravity not as a pulling force, but as "Bernoulli Suction" created by mass acting as a sink in the vacuum fluid.
    *   **The Dark Matter Solution:** Solves the galaxy rotation problem without invisible particles. Using the **Logarithmic Schrödinger Equation (LogSE)**, we model "Dark Matter" as the physical turbulence of the vacuum at galactic scales.

*   **Syncytial Field Theory (SFT):**
    *   **The Continuous Mind:** Addresses the "Binding Problem" by locating consciousness in the brain's **Astroglial Syncytium**—a continuous, isoelectric network that exists alongside discrete neurons.
    *   **Analog Smoothing:** Proposes that the brain converts digital neuronal spikes into continuous subjective experience via electromechanical hysteresis in the cytoskeleton.

**Validation**
The paper includes proposed falsification protocols, including the "Ghost Cable" experiment for non-local field tension and analysis of Wide Binary Star data to confirm the hydrodynamic phase transition of gravity.

*Status: Theoretical Draft v1.0. Logic and derivations are subject to revision.*
